# FPGA-Implementation-of-SPI-Protocol
This project implements the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol using Verilog on the Microsemi SmartFusion2 M2S050 FPGA. The design was created and tested using the Libero SoC Design Suite. The SPI module was verified by interfacing it with an ADXL345 accelerometer, and the results were analyzed on a digital oscilloscope.
